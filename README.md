# Basic Search Strategies

A simple genetic algorithm in Java that evolves a string (like "Hello, World!"), and hill climbing and random algorithms to compare it against.

There are some constants that can be played with:

 - Main.STRING, the string being evolved
 - GeneticAlgorithm.CROSSOVER_RATE, the crossover rate of the genetic algorithm
 - GeneticAlgorithm.MUTATION_RATE, the mutation rate of the genetic algorithm
 - GeneticAlgorithm.POPULATION_SIZE, the population size of the genetic algorithm

This project deepened my understanding of genetic algorithms.
